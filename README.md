# BassGenerator
#### Funk Bass with Recurrent Neural Nets

This code is part of a project to train a generative model to create original funk bass. The training data consisted of 208 funk bass lines in 4 measure segments, 4/4 time signature, and in a midi format.

###### Midi Tools

In order to breakdown and recreate midi files, I used a python package made available on github: https://github.com/vishnubob/python-midi

I played the midi tracks in Ableton music production software, but you can also play the midi tracks with python with pygame: http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/midi.html
